# This is the configuration file for dnsbrute.sh
#
# Lines starting with '#' are interpreted as comments. Blank lines are ignored.
# All valid configuration parameters are shown below. Lines starting with
# parameters not recognized by the program will be ignored.
#
# Commandline parameters ALWAYS have priority over values specified in this
# file. Keep that in mind when something is not (but should be) working.
#
# There's no need to delimit values using single or double-quotes, though you
# can. They will be ignored.


# Trusted DNS server to make lookups. This parameter should specify a TRUSTED
# server, whose answers will be used to verify further lookups for validity.
#
# Default value: 8.8.8.8 (the Google DNS server)
#
#TRUSTED_SERVER = 8.8.8.8


# File containing a list of suspicious servers to lookup. The list of domains
# to be looked up against these servers is specified by the '-d' commandline
# parameter, which is mandatory.
#
# This parameter can either be specified as an absolute path, or relative to
# the 'dnsbrute' program parent directory, for example:
#
#   SUSPICIOUS_SERVERS = /opt/dnsbrute/etc/sservers.db , or
#   SUSPICIOUS_SERVERS = etc/sservers.db
#
# The 'etc/' directory contains a sample file explaining the format of this
# file, named 'sample_sservers.db'.
#
# Default value: unset
#
SUSPICIOUS_SERVERS = 


# Directory containing whitelists to be ignored by the 'dnsbrute' program.
# These whitelists can be generated by the helper 'getrange' program, located
# in the 'bin/' directory.
#
# Whitelists are useful to ignore addresses that can produce false positives
# during program execution, such as alternative IPs for hosts, multiple IPs
# pertaining to a cluster pool or CDN IPs used for content mirroring.
#
# Default value: $DNSBRUTE_HOME/var/whitelists
#
#WHITELIST_DIR = $DNSBRUTE_HOME/var/whitelists
