          dnsbrute, version 1.2.0-beta3

This is top-level directory of the dnsbrute program, a software that can be
used to check suspicious DNS servers for incorrect or malicious responses to
queries against various domains. The responses can then be compared against a
control server (known as the Trusted server) and acted upon. This program can
be used to help organizations whose clients are frequent victims of DNS
spoofing attacks to detect and act upon malicious servers, thus mitigating the
attack.


* Portability notes

This program has been tested and is known to work on various Unix-like systems,
including Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD. As long as you have a recent Bash version
(4.0+), things should Just Work (tm).
