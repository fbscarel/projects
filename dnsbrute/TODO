This a simple to-do list of features that are currently unimplemented:

dnsbrute.sh:

  (DONE) - Implement various methods of output (aside from plain CSV), such as
           pretty-printed stdout, syslog and email.
         - Support whitelists containing IP subranges

getrange.sh:

         - Improve documentation.
         - Provide commandline options as offered by dnsbrute.sh, and a
           configuration file if appropriate.
