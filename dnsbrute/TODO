This a simple to-do list of features that are currently unimplemented:

dnsbrute.sh:

  - Implement various methods of output (aside from plain CSV), such as
    pretty-printed stdout, syslog and email.

getrange.sh:

  - Improve documentation.
  - Provide commandline options as offered by dnsbrute.sh, and a configuration
    file if appropriate.
