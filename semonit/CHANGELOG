monit.sh: 1.1.0, 2014/08/20 fbscarel $

  * Added support for email reporting using the '-m' option. Multiple
    recipients can be passed and should be separated using spaces; in this
    case you MUST enclose the parameter using single or double-quotes. The local
    '/usr/bin/mail' binary will be used, check your Sendmail/Postfix/Exim
    configuration. Check globalvars $SUBJECT and $HEADLINE for email
    customization.

  * Search terms with spaces are now supported using the '-t' option.
    IMPORTANT: you MUST enclose the parameter using single or double-quotes,
    else the command line won't be interpreted fully (getopt limitation).
    Output files under 'searches/' are created using underscores instead of
    spaces.

  * Improved debugging and reporting using the '-v' option.

  * Changed stripdomain() to match various common URLs prefixes, e.g.:
    ww.test.domain, www2.test.domain, wwws58.test.domain, etc.

  * Corrected behavior parsing domains from URLs not preceded by 'http[s]://'.
  
monit.sh: 1.0.0 - 1.0.3, 2014/08/18 fbscarel $

  * No CHANGELOG recorded.
