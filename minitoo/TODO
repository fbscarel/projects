This a simple to-do list of features that are currently unimplemented:

  - Add binarychecks to everything before running to avoid missing
  - Support package versioning (really?)
  - Support OR dependencies (i.e. depends on package X or package Y, ask for
    selection?)
  - Detect packages installed previously and avoid reinstall (hard to do, have
    to recheck compile opts)
  - Add support to different output formats (filesystem, disk partition, ISO
    image, virtual machine file, etc.)
