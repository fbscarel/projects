do NOT set autologin via code, do via deploydir
customize bootloader depending on initramfs existence? get UUIDs automatically?

 - Support package versioning (really?)
 - Support OR dependencies (i.e. depends on package X or package Y, ask for selection?)
 - Detect packages installed previously and avoid reinstall (hard to do, have to recheck compile opts)
