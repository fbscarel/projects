Minitoo is an automatic build system to produce minimal systems from
Gentoo-based distributions, using the Portage build infrastructure and assorted
binaries. The system does not implicate that the user does not have to study
and fully understand Portage, Gentoo and Linux systems in general; rather, it's
intended for advanced users that want to automate the construction of systems
that they have built manually, increasing productivity and reducing intervals
between builds and tests.

This program was written by Felipe Scarel to automate the build of minimal
systems for specialized purposes, such as web servers, application-specific
machines and custom-tailored distributions for ATM systems. The list of authors
