# This is the configuration file for the minitoo.sh script.
#
# Lines starting with '#' are interpreted as comments. Blank lines are ignored.
# All valid configuration parameters are shown below. Lines starting with
# parameters not recognized by the program will be ignored.
#
# Commandline parameters ALWAYS have priority over values specified in this
# file. Keep that in mind when something is not (but should be) working.


# Directory to be used as mountpoint for our build. The device specified using
# the commandline '-d' option or the 'DEVICE' parameter below will be mounted
# on this directory. If no device was specified, the installation will be done
# into the 'BUILD_DIR' directory, but no bootloader-related tasks will be run.
#
# You can specify an absolute value here, or use paths relative to the Minitoo
# package by using the '$MINITOO_HOME' variable, as shown below.
#
# Default value: $MINITOO_HOME/var/build
#
#BUILD_DIR = $MINITOO_HOME/var/build


# Device to be mounted on BUILD_DIR, where our minimal system will reside.
# This device must be a hard disk available under '/dev', such as '/dev/sdb'
# or '/dev/hdc'.
#
# WARNING: the disk selected here will be COMPLETELY wiped, and the program
# will create a single partition spanning the whole disk. The MBR code will
# also be overwritten. Be careful with your selection.
#
# This parameter can be used as a convenience feature, if you want to make
# multiple builds on the same disk and test the outcomes. If you're doing
# single runs, the '-d' commandline option might be better suited for your
# usage.
#
# Default value: unset
#
#DEVICE = 


# Directory to be used as a sort of "configuration overlay" to the minimal
# system. The files on this directory will be copied to the system verbatim.
# This is an useful option to customize your system post-installation.
#
# Keep in mind this directory must emulate the filesystem structure of the
# root ('/') directory. For example, suppose you want to copy a file to the
# destination
#
#   /home/user/file
#
# on the target minimal system. This file must then exist in the 'deploy'
# directory under the very same hierarchy, that is:
#
#   deploy/home/user/file
#
# You can use this option to configure system initialization, copy programs
# and packages that are not included in the default Minitoo program, activate
# startup daemons on boot, and a myriad of other possibilities. Be creative!
#
# Default value: $MINITOO_HOME/var/deploy
#
#DEPLOY_DIR = $MINITOO_HOME/var/deploy


# List of packages to be installed on the minimal system. This parameter
# should contain a SPACE-SEPARATED list of packages; do not use commas or
# other separators. The complete list of packages can be found on the
# 'lib/package.sh' file.
#
# Be careful when removing any of the preset defaults on this parameter.
# Critical components (such as the kernel, a libc or an init system), if
# removed, can render your minimal system unbootable.
#
# If needed, you may easily add new packages to Minitoo. Read the
# 'etc/package.d/README.package' file for detailed instructions.
#
# Default value:
#     baselayout
#     busybox
#     extlinux
#     glibc
#     kernel
#     shadow
#     sysvinit
#     udev
#
#INSTALL_PACKAGES = baselayout busybox extlinux glibc kernel shadow sysvinit udev


# List of locales to be kept installed on the minimal system. All locales EXCEPT
# the ones on this list will be REMOVED from the target system.  Locales should
# be specified as a SPACE-SEPARATED list; do not use commas or other separators.
# Valid locales follow the format:
#
#   language_TERRITORY
#
# For example:
#
#   de_BE
#   en_US
#   es_ES
#   pt_BR
#
# Consult the file 'etc/locales' for a list of valid locales, largely based on
# the official '/usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED' file.
#
# The 'en_US' locale will always be kept for compatibility purposes. If
# unspecified, all locales will be kept in the minimal system.
#
# Default value: unset
#
#LOCALES =


# Add and/or delete DAEMONS to the installed minimal system boot. This set of
# commands is run on a chroot, calling 'rc-update' to perform the desired
# changes.
#
# The parameter to this option is a string on a fixed format, as shown in the
# example below:
# 
#  DAEMON_OPTS = a:dbus@boot net.enp0s8 xdm,d:netmount swap swapfiles
#
# The character 'a' followed by a colon indicates the daemons that should be
# (A)dded to system boot. If no runlevel is indicated, the daemon will be added
# to the 'default' runlevel. Otherwise, set the desired runlevel with using a
# '@' character, as shown with the 'dbus' daemon above.
#
# The character 'd' followed by a colon indicated the daemons that should be
# (D)eleted from system boot. There's no need to specify a runlevel in this
# case, Minitoo will auto-detect.
#
# (A)dd targets will be processed BEFORE (D)elete targets. If the" same daemon
# is present in both lists, it will ultimately be kept" in a deleted state."
#
# You should separate the 'a' (Add) and 'd' (Delete) daemon lists with a comma
# (','), as shown in the example above. Daemon names inside each list are
# separated by spaces. If no option is set, default daemon startup options will
# not be changed.
#
# Default value: unset
#
#DAEMON_OPTS =
