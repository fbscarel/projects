## This is a file to hold client public keys timestamp information.
## Expired keys can be cleaned up using the 'cleankeys.sh' cron script under
## the 'cron/' folder. Consider running this script daily to keep client keys
## under control.
##
## Syntax: TIMESTAMP KEY
##
## TIMESTAMP is in Unix epoch format. If you want to have a key ignored (and,
## as a consequence, never expiring), simply swap its TIMESTAMP with an
## asterisk ('*'), for example:
##
## * ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz[...]BB7MHw== user@host
