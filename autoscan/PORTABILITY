AutoScan has been tested with a number of UNIX-like operating systems to ensure
maximum compatibility. Specifically, the software has been run under Linux x64,
Linux x32, OpenBSD and FreeBSD, and there's no reason to assume it wouldn't work
in other UNIX-like environments. To successfully operate the software
server-side, however, there are a number of dependencies and considerations that
have to be followed, as described in this file.

When running AutoScan on a Linux x64 host, everything should Just Work (tm).
Precompiled versions of extra binaries are provided, so no compilation is
needed. Simply follow the instructions contained in the README file.


* Running on other UNIX-like systems

If running on a non-Linux x64 environment (Linux x32, *BSD, Solaris, etc.), the
precompiled binaries will not work. Go into the 'extra' directory and follow the
instructions outlined below for your operating system.

To recompile the software, you will need the following:

  - gcc
  - GNU Autoconf
  - GNU Automake

On FreeBSD, make sure you also have the "devel/pkgconf" package installed.

Additional software could be needed depending on your specific environment. Pay
close attention to the output from 'configure' to try and solve any problems.

Instructions for osslsigncode:

  - All: simply run 'configure' and 'make'.
  - OpenBSD: run 'configure' as usual. Pass the variables AUTOCONF_VERSION and
      AUTOMAKE_VERSION to the 'make' command (consult `pkg_info` for version
      information).

Instructions for putty-src/unix:

  - All: run 'configure' with the flag '--without-gtk' to remove GTK libraries
      from the completed build, which reduces build time significantly. Run
      'make' afterwards.


* Other dependencies:

Aside from the bundled source code/binaries, AutoScan depends on a number of
external software to operate correctly. Make sure you have the following
binaries on your $PATH before running the program:

  - GNU bash, version 3.2+
  - Python interpreter, version 2.4+
  - expect (from the Tcl/Tk toolkit)
  - a modern OpenSSH 'sshd' implementation, preferably version 6.0+
  - a modern 'nc' (netcat) implementation, supporting the '-n' and '-z' options
  - '7z' or '7za' binaries for the 7-zip file archiver, version 9.20+
  - any binary providing MD5 or SHA (various formats) checksum creation
