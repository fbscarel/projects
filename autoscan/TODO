This a simple to-do list of features that are currently unimplemented:

autoscan.sh:

  (DONE) - Checksum (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512) support
  (DONE) - Sign executables with ACTUAL valid certificates (use the one from
           Java applets)
  (DONE) - User permission check to TARGET directory before executable creation
  (DONE) - Implement expiring user public keys on SSH with configurable
           intervals, make a cron script server-side cronjob check for root
           status
  (DONE) - Filename timestamping option on uploads to avoid collision
  (DONE) - Generate program using Java language
  (DONE) - Check for binary compatibily on compile targets before running
  (DONE) - Reimplement user permission check in a portable fashion
  (DONE) - Document portability targets and program dependencies
         - Investigate FreeBSD compile issues

fca:

  (DONE) - Create window with a "I agree" checkbox explaining that the program
           could access browsers history files, extensions and plugins
         - Selective network disabling/enabling to only allow outbound
           communications to the SSH server (use Windows firewall
           configuration?)
         - Explain better another things that the program could access or do in
           the user's machine.
         - Decide what text goes in "I agree" window.
         - Document Java program
